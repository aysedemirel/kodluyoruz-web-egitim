/**
 * Enter an extra grade in each Course and calculate its effect on the average for each course separately.
 * Include the extra grades with the percentage of their effect on the average.
 * <br/>
 * For example:
 * If the extra grade of the physics course has a 20% effect on the average,
 * the effect of the exam grade is 80%.
 * If the student received a 90 in the extra grade and a 60 in the exam,
 * the effect of that course on the general average is calculated as follows:
 * <br/>
 * Physics Average: (90 * 0.20) + (60 * 0.80);
